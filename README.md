# OpenCLISpec

Welcome to OpenCLISpec, an open specification designed to define and document command-line tools, similar to OpenAPI but tailored specifically for the CLI ecosystem. Our mission is to standardize command-line interfaces to enhance automation and interoperability across various tools and platforms.

## Vision

In an era where automation is key, OpenCLISpec aims to provide a unified framework that empowers developers to create, document, and share command-line tools seamlessly. By establishing a common standard, we enable AI-driven use cases such as command generation, autocompletion, code scaffolding, and orchestration, making it easier for developers to build and integrate CLI applications.

Together, let's revolutionize the CLI ecosystem for better automation and interoperability!
